As George Box once said 'all models are wrong, but some are useful', I am among those who are trying to find these useful models. I am an enthusiast, hard working and lifelong learner. I enjoy solving the problems, whether they are small or big. I am studying big data analytics and different types of methodologies and algorithms supporting it. I have an interest in data science, sociology, economics and I am exploring how these fields are interdependent. Currently I am working on social network analysis and influence modelling.

Before coming to NUS for my masters, I was working as a software developer in India. I worked as a full stacked Java developer using Java, python, spring, hibernate, MySQL, Cassandra, JavaScript, HTML, spark and many other technologies.Â 

I completed my computer engineering degree from Pune University. I was an active member of college Robotics and computer engineering. I enjoyed taking part in competitions and using my knowledge to develop a working thing.

One last thing, I enjoy discussions with people on any topic. I feel it's important for developing our perspective and understanding of things around us. If you have anything to discuss and want a partner, please feel free to contact.
